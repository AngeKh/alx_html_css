                <p> The program offers a wide range of courses covering various aspects of software engineering,
                    including programming languages, algorithms, data structures and software development methodologies. 
                </p>
                <p>It also provides open educational resources. These resources may include lecture notes, 
                    assignments, videos, and other materials that are freely available for self-study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are community-driven initiatives and projects focused on providing education to learners around the continent. These initiatives may include online forums, discussion groups, and collaborative learning 
                    platforms where participants can share knowledge, ask questions, and collaborate on projects.

                <h3>In General</h3>
                <p>
                    Free software engineering programs often allow learners to study at their own pace and
                    on their own schedule. This flexibility makes them suitable for individuals with busy schedules 
                    or those who prefer self-directed learning.
